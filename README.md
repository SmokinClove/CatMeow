# CatMeow
This is a Java Application created by Wu XiaoXiao and Nguyen Tuong Van.
Open Cat.java as an application.

The CatMeow project is an OpenGL application, using Java as a wrapper around the OpenGL code to reap the benefits of OOP and ease the making of a desktop application with Java's built-in awt library - known as JOGL.

Once the application opens, a picture of a cat - drawn with OpenGL by XiaoXiao - appears. Upon each click, you hear a 'meow', which is a wav file to be stored in the same directory as the application. This is done by Tuong Van's Java code.

Enjoy!
